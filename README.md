**Data Access Restrictions**  
Due to the confidentiality of high-precision 3D oblique photogrammetry data, the original 3D datasets (such as unprocessed point clouds and imagery data) cannot be made publicly available. We are only able to provide processed visualization matrix files, which have been anonymized and are suitable for public sharing.
Data Provided:
Processed visualization matrix files, which include the matrix data obtained after the oblique photogrammetry process, used for analysis and further research.
Algorithm code related to the matrix data, including scripts and tools used for data processing and visualization.
